    <p>
        A delicate and creamy dish enjoyed by the upper classes, this almond milk-based soup was a medieval favorite. 
        Thickened with bread and lightly spiced with cinnamon and saffron, it offers a smooth, comforting texture with a touch of sweetness. 
        Almond milk was often used in place of dairy during fasting periods, making this dish both luxurious and versatile.
