    <h1>Roast Capon with Spices</h1>

    <p>
        This roast capon, flavored with a blend of ginger, cloves, and black pepper, reflects the medieval love of spiced meats. 
        The combination of vinegar and honey forms a rich glaze that caramelizes as the bird roasts, creating a balance of sweet, savory, and tangy flavors. 
        Capon was a prized bird, often served at feasts and special occasions.
